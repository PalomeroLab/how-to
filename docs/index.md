![logo](img/CUIMC_Horizontal_Blue.png)

Welcome to the Palomero Lab How-To guide!
This is a collection of instructions and tips for common bioinformatics tasks,
focused on Linux-based workflows and AWS cloud computing.

## What's in this guide?

This guide covers a range of topics including:

- Setting up and using AWS services
- Running bioinformatics tools and pipelines
- Managing data with command-line interfaces
- Writing effective scripts for automation
- Using Rstudio and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis

> [!TIP]
> These files are written using [GitHub Flavored Markdown \(GFM\)](https://github.github.com/gfm/),
> a superset of the [original](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
> lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.
> GFM gives us additional features (like tables, footnotes, and alerts
> like this) while maintaining readability in plain text.
