# IAM

Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) to manage users, groups, and policies.

## Users

To create a user: `IAM` > `Users` > `Create user`

> [!CAUTION]
> Providing user access to the AWS Management Console is a security risk.
> If you must provide access, create an autogenerated password and require
> the user to change it upon first login.

Don't attach specific policies to users. Instead, create groups and attach
policies to groups. Then, add users to groups.

## Groups and Policies

We have three custom groups:

| Group Name | Policies                                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LabAdmin   | AdministratorAccess                                                    |
| LabUser    | FullAccess to IAM, CloudShell, EC2, S3, and Glacier                    |
| LabGuest   | AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess, AmazonGlacierFullAccess, IAMUserChangePassword |

Lab guests are collaborators who need read-only access to S3 and Glacier.

### Inline Policies

Inline policies are policies that are directly attached to a user or group.
For example, to use the Serial Console:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowinstanceBasedSerialConsoleAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ec2-instance-connect:SendSerialConsoleSSHPublicKey"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

More about this syntax can be found in the [IAM Policy Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html).
