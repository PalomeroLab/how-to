# S3

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

| Operation       | Command                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| List Buckets    | `aws s3 ls`                                 |
| Create a Bucket | `aws s3 mb s3://my-new-bucket`              |
| Upload a File   | `aws s3 cp localfile.txt s3://my-bucket/`   |
| Download a File | `aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/remotefile.txt .` |
| Sync Files      | `aws s3 sync <source> <target> [--options]` |

Note: For the sync command, replace `<source>` and `<target>` with appropriate local or S3 paths, and add any necessary options.

Options include:

| Option      | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `--exclude` | Exclude files matching the pattern           |
| `--include` | Include files matching the pattern           |
| `--dryrun`  | Simulate the sync operation                  |
| `--delete`  | Remove files in target not present in source |
| `--quiet`   | Suppress non-error output                    |

Example:

```sh
aws s3 sync . s3://my-bucket/backup --exclude "*.tmp" --delete
```

> [!TIP]
> Use the "Copy S3 URI" button in the S3 console to easily copy bucket/object URIs.

## Working with S3 Objects

### Rename/Move Objects

While `mv` exists, it's not atomic. Use `cp` followed by `rm` for better control:

```sh
aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/oldname s3://my-bucket/newname \
    && aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/oldname
```

### List Objects with a Specific Prefix

```sh
aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket/prefix/
```

### Delete Multiple Objects

```sh
aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/prefix --recursive
```

## S3 Storage Classes

S3 offers various [storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/) for different use cases:

- Standard
- Intelligent-Tiering
- Glacier Instant Retrieval
- Glacier Deep Archive

### Working with Glacier Storage Class

To restore a Glacier object:

```sh
aws s3api restore-object --bucket my-bucket --key path/to/object --restore-request '{"Days":5,"GlacierJobParameters":{"Tier":"Standard"}}'
```

[documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/restore-object.html)

Check restore status:

```sh
aws s3api head-object --bucket my-bucket --key path/to/object
```

When downloading restored Glacier objects:

```sh
aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/path/to/object . --force-glacier-transfer
```

## Mounting S3 as a Filesystem

Using [mountpoint-s3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3):

1. Install:

On Ubuntu:

```sh
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.deb
sudo apt-get install ./mount-s3.deb -y && rm mount-s3.deb
```

On macOS:

```sh
brew install --cask macfuse # install the prerequisite FUSE library
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/arm64/mount-s3.tar.gz
sudo mkdir -p /opt/aws/mountpoint-s3 && sudo tar -C /opt/aws/mountpoint-s3 -xzf ./mount-s3.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/aws/mountpoint-s3/bin # add to .zshrc
```

2. Mount:

```sh
mkdir -vp /mnt/s3/my-bucket
mount-s3 my-bucket /mnt/s3/my-bucket
```

For more information, refer to the
[Mountpoint S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mountpoint.html).

### Quick start

Create mountpoints for each bucket you have access to:

```sh
for bucket in $(aws s3 ls | awk '{print $3}'); do
    mkdir -vp ./s3/$bucket
    mount-s3 $bucket ./s3/$bucket
done
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This command will mount all buckets you have access to in the present working
> directory. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that this is where
> you want to mount the buckets.
