# R, RStudio, and RStudio Server

## Overview

R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, providing a console, syntax-highlighting editor, and tools for plotting, debugging, and workspace management. RStudio Server is a version of RStudio that runs on a remote server and is accessed through a web browser, ideal for cloud-based or shared computing environments.

## Installation

Use the docker image `rocker/rstudio` to run RStudio Server in a containerized environment. You can pull the image from Docker Hub and run it with the following command:

```sh
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=yourpasswordhere rocker/rstudio
```

## Connecting to RStudio Server

Find your EC2 instance's public IP address in the AWS console. Ensure that inbound traffic on port 8787 is allowed in the EC2 security group settings. Access RStudio Server by navigating to `http://ec2-public-ip:8787` in your web browser.

## RStudio Server Login

RStudio Server uses the underlying Linux system's user accounts. The default `ubuntu` user doesn't have a password set, so create one:

```sh
sudo passwd ubuntu
```

The RStudio Server console has elevated privileges, allowing you to run commands like `passwd` or `adduser` directly.

## Package Management

### Installing Packages

For system-wide package installation, ensure you have the necessary build tools:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
```

To install specific versions of R packages:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_version("Seurat", version = "4.4.1")
```

### renv: R Environment Management

renv is a package management tool for R that creates project-specific libraries, ensuring reproducibility across different environments.

Setting up renv:

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::init()
```

Using renv:

```r
install.packages("dplyr")  # Install packages as usual
renv::snapshot()  # Snapshot your project's state
renv::restore()  # Restore your project's state on another machine
```

Best practices with renv:

- Commit `renv.lock` to version control.
- Use `renv::status()` to check for unsaved changes in your project's package list.
- Regularly update your snapshot with `renv::snapshot()`.

RStudio provides visual cues for renv usage in the "Packages" pane and access to common renv functions through the "renv" menu.

### Troubleshooting

If `renv::restore()` fails, check for package conflicts and ensure necessary system libraries are installed. If `sessionInfo()` shows unexpected packages, check your `.Rprofile` for auto-loaded packages and verify you're in the correct project environment.
