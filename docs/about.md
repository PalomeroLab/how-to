# About this guide

## Foreword

I was inspired by Tony Narlock's [The Tao of tmux](https://tao-of-tmux.readthedocs.io/)
by take the collection of notes I had written on Linux-based bioinformatic
workflows and turn them into a guide for others to use. After all, science
is a collaborative effort and what good does documentation do if it's not
[FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)](https://go-fair.org/fair-principles/)?
